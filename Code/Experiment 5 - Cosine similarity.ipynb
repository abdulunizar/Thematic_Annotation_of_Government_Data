saw it as their civic duty a plus of points compared to compared to the european elections significantly more citizens have also voted because they are in favour of the eu or because they felt they could change things by voting in member states citizens primarily voted because they saw it as their duty as citizens in all member states more respondents than in voted because they were in favour of the eu looking at the issues that made citizens vote the post electoral survey shows that top issues which impacted on citizens voting decision were economy and growth climate change as well as human

Corine Land Cover (CLC) provides consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. This inventory was initiated in 1985 (reference year 1990) and established a time series of land cover information with updates in 2000 and 2006.CLC products are based on photointerpretation of satellite images by national teams of participating countries - the EEA member and cooperating countries \\x96 following a standard methodology and nomenclature with the following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical three level Corine nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for the change layers is 5 hectares. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe.Land cover and land use (LCLU) information is important not only for land change research, but also more broadly for the monitoring of environmental change, policy support, the creation of environmental indicators and reporting. CLC datasets provide important datasets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive, among others.More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Copernicus land monitoring data in general can be found at http://land.copernicus.eu/.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":157}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#remove the unwanted coloumns \n","encoded_data=encoded_data.drop(['Translated'], axis=1)\n","encoded_data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":800},"id":"POoeJQdYyvRH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683892156419,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":190,"user":{"displayName":"Mohsan Ali","userId":"05297749402251279432"}},"outputId":"2e39b5e1-98c7-40e3-ff30-1cb99df2a482"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       theme_AGRI  theme_ECON  theme_EDUC  theme_ENER  theme_ENVI  theme_GOVE  \\\n","0               0           0           0           0           1           0   \n","1               0           0           0           0           1           0   \n","2               0           0           0           0           1           0   \n","3               0           0           0           0           0           1   \n","4               0           0           0           0           1           0   \n","...           ...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ...   \n","29789           1           0           0           0           0           0   \n","29790           0           1           0           0           0           0   \n","29791           0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","29792           0           0           0           0           1           0   \n","29793           0           0           0           0           0           1   \n","\n","       theme_HEAL  theme_INTR  theme_JUST  theme_REGI  theme_SOCI  theme_TECH  \\\n","0               1           0           0           0           0           0   \n","1               0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","2               0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","3               0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","4               0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","...           ...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ...   \n","29789           0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","29790           0           0           0           1           0           0   \n","29791           0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","29792           0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","29793           0           0           0           0           0           0   \n","\n","       theme_TRAN                               TitlePlusDescription  \n","0               0  Areas of Potential Significant Flood Risk (APS...  \n","1               0                     coloniiTcolonii pasari in RBDD  \n","2               0  INSPIRE Elevation (el-vec) IcelandELF Elevatio...  \n","3               0  2019 -

Finance is the study of money and how it is used. Specifically, it deals with the questions of how an individual, company or government acquires the money needed and how they then spend or invest that money. Dataset examples: Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) - public procurement notices from the EU and beyond; General government deficit (-) and surplus (+) - quarterly data.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Education, culture and sport This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as education, culture or sport. Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs and habits. Culture encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities and habits of the individuals in these groups. Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Dataset examples: European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO); EU Member States and international human rights obligations; Participation in any cultural or sport activities in the last 12 months by sex, age and educational attainment level.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Energy This concept identifies datasets covering the domain of energy. Energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Living organisms require energy to stay alive; human civilisation requires energy to function. Dataset examples: European gas market reports; Electricity prices by type of user.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Environment This concept identifies datasets covering the domain of environment. The natural environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. Dataset examples: Attitudes of European citizens towards the environment; Pollutant emissions from transport.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Government and public sector This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as government or public sector. A government is the system or group of people governing an organised community, often a state. The public sector is the part of the economy composed of both public services and public enterprises. Public sector services and enterprises can be controlled by central government, regional or local authorities. Organisations that are not part of the public sector are either a part of the private sector or voluntary sector. Dataset examples: Candidate countries and potential candidates: Government statistics; Transparency Register.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Health This concept identifies datasets covering the domain of health. Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent. Dataset examples: COVID-19 Coronavirus data; European Cancer Information System.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Justice, legal system and public safety This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as justice, legal system or public safety. Justice includes both the attainment of that which is just and the philosophical discussion of that which is just; here it mainly means the procedural justice as found in the study and application of the law. The contemporary legal systems of the world are generally based on one of four basic systems: civil law, common law, statutory law, religious law or combinations of these. Public safety is the function of governments which ensures the protection of citizens, persons in their territory, organisations and institutions against threats to their well-being – and to the prosperity of their communities. Dataset examples: EU case-law; Information on Member States Law; European Data Protection Supervisor register of processing operations.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Population and society This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as population or society. Population is a collection of humans and their entire race; it is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world. A society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Dataset examples: Population density by NUTS 2 region; Violence against Women: An EU-wide survey.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Science and technology This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as science or technology. Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organises knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions. Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences, which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences, which study abstract concepts. Technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Dataset examples: CORDIS - EU research projects under Horizon 2020 (2014-2020); Take-up of mobile broadband (subscriptions/100 people).\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Transport This concept identifies datasets covering the domain of transport. Transport is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline and space. Dataset examples: Total length of motorways; Airport traffic data by reporting airport and airlines.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as agriculture, fisheries, forestry or food. Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock. Fisheries are activities leading to harvesting of fish; may involve capture of wild fish or raising of fish through aquaculture. Forestry is the science and craft of creating, managing, using, conserving and repairing forests, woodlands and associated resources for human and environmental benefits. Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Dataset examples: Agricultural and Vegetable Catalogue; The Community Fishing Fleet Register; Pan-European Map of Forest Biomass Increment; Food composition database for nutrient intake: selected vitamins and minerals in selected European countries.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : International issues This concept identifies datasets covering the domain of international issues. An issue – important topic or problem for debate or discussion – is international when the participants represent at least two countries. Dataset examples: Consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanctions; European Commission — DG DEVCO – development and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\n","PrefLabel+Definition    : Regions and cities This concept identifies datasets covering such domains as regions or cities. In the field of political geography, regions tend to be based on political units such as sovereign states; subnational units such as administrative regions, provinces, states, counties, townships, territories, etc.; and multinational groupings. A city is a large human settlement. Dataset examples: NUTS - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics classification; UDP - GDP per capita by metro regions, 2000 - 2060.\n"]}],"source":["definition_embeddings = []\n","for
