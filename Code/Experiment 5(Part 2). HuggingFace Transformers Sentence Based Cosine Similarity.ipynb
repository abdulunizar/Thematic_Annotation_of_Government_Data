movement artificial ground and linear features bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth s crust bedrock is present everywhere whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy the lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock type and geological time of formation where rock types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme for example intrusive deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types then their classification is based on their rock type or lithological composition this assesses visible features such as texture structure mineralogy superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time the quaternary these deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock the superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas shown as polygons attributed with a geological name and their deposit type or lithological composition mass movement describes areas where deposits have moved down slope under gravity to form landslips these landslips can affect bedrock superficial or artificial ground mass movement deposits are described in the bgs rock classification scheme volume however this data also includes foundered strata where ground has collapsed due to subsidence this is not described in the rock classification scheme caution should be exercised with this data historically bgs has not always recorded mass movement events and due to the dynamic nature of occurrence significant changes may have occurred since the data was released artificial man made theme shown as polygons indicates areas where the ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity whilst artificial ground may not be considered as part of the real geology of bedrock and superficial deposits it does affect them artificial ground impacts on the near surface ground conditions which are important to human activities and economic development due to the constantly changing nature of land use and re use redevelopment caution must be exercised when using this data as it represents a snapshot in time rather than an evolving picture hence the data may become dated very rapidly linear features shown as polylines represent geological structural features e g faults folds or landforms e g buried channels glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface beneath superficial deposits linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits all five data themes are available in vector format containing the geometry of each feature linked to a database record describing their attributes as esri shapefiles

distribution was examined with sidescan sonar reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment

assessment historical analysis of floods nbsp events of bar cetinje danilovgrad nicksic podgorica shkodracomprehensive knowledge of a number of disasters that occurred in the past is provided through the spatial extent of the floods mainly linked with rainfall and assessment of their impact on existing assets as well as information on land use cover and existing assets and infrastructures to efficiently support quot informed quot decisions on flood risk management activities and planning of prevention protection and preparedness measures through accounting for the area characteristics the flood hazard was assessed flood risk mapping ndash hazard assessment nbsp towards reducing the adverse consequences of flooding for both population and economic activity flood hazard assessment was implemented within the drin catchment area due to the characteristics of the drin river basin for the estimation of the maximum flood extent a morphological approach was deployed for the catchment area upstream of skadar lake based upon the flood susceptibility index fsi while a hydraulic modelling was implemented for the buna river within a mainly flat area of the aoi from the skadar lake to the adriatic sea telemac model through using a very high resolution dem flood risk mapping economic risk assessment nbsp the overall economic risk assessment was implemented through the use of the
