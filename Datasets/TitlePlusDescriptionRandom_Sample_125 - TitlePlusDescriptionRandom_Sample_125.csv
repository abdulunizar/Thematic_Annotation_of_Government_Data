1361,"biological zones of the EU's Atlantic AreaThis layer is a model of the biological zones of the EU's 'Atlantic Area 2007-2013'. It was performed within the framework of MeshAtlantic project (INTERREG Atlantic Area 2007-2013 program).
This layer was modelled with the use of bespoke base layers that were the bathymetry,  wave wavelength and the kdpar
The biological zones boundaries were defined in the following way.
- Infralittoral lower limit: limit at which the percentage of light reaching the seabed is 1%. The percentage of light layer was calculated by intersecting the kdpar and the bathymetry layers. For more details about this calculation see e.g. Vasquez et al. (in press).
- Circalittoral lower limit: limit at which the ratio wave wave length over the depth equals 2.53
- Deep circalittoral lower limit: break of slope due to the entrance into the continental slope. This limit was digitalized with the use of the bathymetry layer
- Upper slope lower limit: depth 750m
- Upper bathyal lower limit: depth 1100m
- Mid bathyal lower limit: depth 1800m
- Lower bathyal lower limit: break of slope due to the entrance into the abyssal plain. This limit was digitalized with the use of the bathymetry layer
Deep biological zones (from upper slope to abyssal) were chosen according to the classification proposed by Howell (2010).

Activation reason: <br/> 
The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the Spanish province of Salamanca (Spain), on 17th August 2021. Active flames were located in San Felices de los Gallegos and Ba&ntilde;ob&aacute;rez, as well as in the areas known as La Granja and Los Navazos, on the edge of the Arribes del Duero natural park. The presence of several outbreaks suggests that it could have been an intentional fire.The goal of the activation has been to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation and the damage assessment.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 1608.22 ha burnt, of which 1596.21 ha only slightly damaged and 12.01 ha moderately damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the damage from the fire has not been serious. The largest damaged area was covered by sclerophyllous vegetation. Damage to the agricultural sector was minimal, but several warehouse buildings were affected. <br/>

This was done to establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the reef habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to assess the extent and distribution of serpulid reefs from observations by diver along 110 transects around the loch. Detailed studies were also performed at four of the major serpulid reef sites in the loch. Here, distribution was examined with sidescan sonar, reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment. The distribution and abundance of Modiolus was examined along seven relocatable transects and, at one of the major mussel beds, the size structure of the population and associated community surveyed.

The study is based on recent industry data supplied by the European copper industry, and thus reflecting the reality in copper semis fabrication. In comparing copper architectural sheets with other roofing and facade materials by means of Life Cycle Assessment should be based on the functional unit, with a sheet thickness of 0.6 mm. This thickness is the most commonly available in the market today for roofing purposes. The use phase of copper roofing is one of the longest, easily reaching well beyond 100 years. Copper church roofs still functional after more than 500 years are known. The type of covering and the inclination of the roof should also be considered. The mass of one m2 of sheet may not necessarily be equivalent to one m2 of roof or one m2 of building surface. The specific properties of each material, the underlying support structures and the design all need to be considered. Many cradle to grave life cycle assessment studies have shown that the environmental aspects from the use and end of life phases of products are often significant. The economic value of copper scrap, based on its ability to be recycled 100% without any loss in performance, must be included in comparative assessments.

Technical Purpose: Copper sheet is typically used in building and construction (roofing, cladding, etc.). For industrial use e.g. electrical engineering the thickness is in general finer.

Hazard assessment data, economic assets and vulnerability information were accounted to generate a percentage damage of the single asset types. The economic risk was then evaluated on the basis of the economic value information of the asset type/category per square metre, and the effective area occupied by each category.&nbsp; <br/>

Energy carrier mix information based on official statistical information including import / export. A detailed heat plant model was used, which combine measured emissions plus calculated values for not measured emissions of e.g. organics or heavy metals. Energy carrier extraction and processing data is of sufficient to good (e.g. refinery) data quality. Inventory is partly based on primary industry data, partly on secondary literature data.

Technical Purpose: Process steam (MJ) at heat plant for final consumers.

6093,"Identifying the main cross-border obstacles to the Digital Single Market and where they matter most: DSM consumer survey (2015)The survey was based on data collected within the scope of a wider investigation that feeds into one of the Commissions top priorities: to create a borderless Digital Single Market (DSM) across Europe. The Commissions DSM strategy for Europe, announced on May 6, 2015, aims to provide better access to tangible and digital goods and services, to create the right environment for the development and commercial success of digital innovation, and to maximise the growth of the digital economy across the EU28. As support and evidence base, two surveys of online consumers were carried out, looking particularly into their purchase activity for 12 types of tangible goods and offline services (e.g. clothes, travel services), usage of 4 types of online services (e.g. communication services) and access to 8 types of digital content (e.g. e-books). These included a core survey (covering online consumers from all EU28, Norway and Iceland) and a clickstream survey (targeted to online respondents from Belgium and Poland only who had expressed the intention to make at least one immediate online purchase). The main objectives of the study were: 1) to examine the current state of play of cross-border e-commerce in the EU28 and 2) to identify the main drivers and barriers to the proper functioning of a DSM across the EU.
