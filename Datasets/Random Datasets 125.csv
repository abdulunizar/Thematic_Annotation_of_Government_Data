It was performed within the framework of MeshAtlantic project (INTERREG Atlantic Area 2007-2013 program).
This layer was modelled with the use of bespoke base layers that were the bathymetry,  wave wavelength and the kdpar
The biological zones boundaries were defined in the following way.
- Infralittoral lower limit: limit at which the percentage of light reaching the seabed is 1%. The percentage of light layer was calculated by intersecting the kdpar and the bathymetry layers. For more details about this calculation see e.g. Vasquez et al. (in press).
- Circalittoral lower limit: limit at which the ratio wave wave length over the depth equals 2.53
- Deep circalittoral lower limit: break of slope due to the entrance into the continental slope. This limit was digitalized with the use of the bathymetry layer
- Upper slope lower limit: depth 750m
- Upper bathyal lower limit: depth 1100m
- Mid bathyal lower limit: depth 1800m
- Lower bathyal lower limit: break of slope due to the entrance into the abyssal plain. This limit was digitalized with the use of the bathymetry layer
Deep biological zones (from upper slope to abyssal) were chosen according to the classification proposed by Howell (2010).

The CEMS Risk and Recovery Standard (RRM STD) has been activated by the Spanish General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies (CENEM) on behalf of the Ministry of Interior of Spain, D. G. Guardia Civil and Jefatura del Seprona, following the forest fire that broke out in the Spanish province of Salamanca (Spain), on 17th August 2021. Active flames were located in San Felices de los Gallegos and Ba&ntilde;ob&aacute;rez, as well as in the areas known as La Granja and Los Navazos, on the edge of the Arribes del Duero natural park. The presence of several outbreaks suggests that it could have been an intentional fire.The goal of the activation has been to provide wildfire damage delineation and grading products that will support the police investigation and the damage assessment.The P07-Wildfire delineation and grading product has been generated by using post-event VHR satellite images. The analysis resulted in 1608.22 ha burnt, of which 1596.21 ha only slightly damaged and 12.01 ha moderately damaged.The P14-Impact assessment analysis on assets and population shows that the damage from the fire has not been serious.

This was done to establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the reef habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to assess the extent and distribution of serpulid reefs from observations by diver along 110 transects around the loch. Detailed studies were also performed at four of the major serpulid reef sites in the loch. Here, distribution was examined with sidescan sonar, reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment. The distribution and abundance of Modiolus was examined along seven relocatable transects and, at one of the major mussel beds, the size structure of the population and associated community surveyed. Subtidal rocky reefs were surveyed by diver along relocatable transects at three sites.","Extent of Serpulid reef and Modiolus modiolus beds in Loch Creran Marine Environmental Data and Information Network The purpose of the current study was to initiate site condition monitoring of the reefs of Loch Creran.

Investigations are done with regard to the following issues of concern primarily (Kellermann, A. et al. 1994):

- Effects of climate change on the morphology,
- Effects of pollutant inputs (nutrients and contaminants) on processes, species and communities,
- Effects of fisheries on species and communities,

Eine Auswertung der Monitoringdaten ermöglicht eine Beurteilung des Zustandes im Wattenmeer vor dem Hintergrund der trilateral vereinbarten ökologischen Entwicklungsziele. Die Ergebnisse werden etwa alle fünf Jahre im Qualitätszustandsbericht veröffentlicht. Dabei stehen Erhebungen zu folgenden Komplexen im Vordergrund (Kellermann, A. et al. 1994):

- Folgen möglicher Klimaänderungen auf Hydrologie, Morphologie und Habitate des Wattenmeeres,
- Auswirkungen von Nähr- und Schadstoffeinträgen auf geochemische und biologische Prozesse sowie auf Arten und Lebensgemeinschaften des Wattenmeeres,

An evaluation of the monitoring data enables the state in the Wadden Sea against the background of the trilaterally agreed ecological development goals. The results are published every five years in the quality status report. The focus is on surveys on the following complexes (Kellermann, A. et al. 1994):

- Consequences of possible climate changes to hydrology, morphology and habitats of the Wadden Sea,
- Effects of nutrients and pollutants on geochemical and biological processes as well as on the species and communities of the Wadden Sea,

The Commissions DSM strategy for Europe, announced on May 6, 2015, aims to provide better access to tangible and digital goods and services, to create the right environment for the development and commercial success of digital innovation, and to maximise the growth of the digital economy across the EU28. As support and evidence base, two surveys of online consumers were carried out, looking particularly into their purchase activity for 12 types of tangible goods and offline services (e.g. clothes, travel services), usage of 4 types of online services (e.g. communication services) and access to 8 types of digital content (e.g. e-books). These included a core survey (covering online consumers from all EU28, Norway and Iceland) and a clickstream survey (targeted to online respondents from Belgium and Poland only who had expressed the intention to make at least one immediate online purchase). The main objectives of the study were: 1) to examine the current state of play of cross-border e-commerce in the EU28 and 2) to identify the main drivers and barriers to the proper functioning of a DSM across the EU.

The Commissions DSM strategy for Europe, announced on May 6, 2015, aims to provide better access to tangible and digital goods and services, to create the right environment for the development and commercial success of digital innovation, and to maximise the growth of the digital economy across the EU28. As support and evidence base, two surveys of online consumers were carried out, looking particularly into their purchase activity for 12 types of tangible goods and offline services (e.g. clothes, travel services), usage of 4 types of online services (e.g. communication services) and access to 8 types of digital content (e.g. e-books). These included a core survey (covering online consumers from all EU28, Norway and Iceland) and a clickstream survey (targeted to online respondents from Belgium and Poland only who had expressed the intention to make at least one immediate online purchase). The main objectives of the study were: 1) to examine the current state of play of cross-border e-commerce in the EU28 and 2) to identify the main drivers and barriers to the proper functioning of a DSM across the EU.

A geo-map depicting the percentage of online shoppers who purchased or accessed products online from another EU country in 2014, together with the top countries of purchase/access, is depicted in the infographic of the 2015 Consumer Conditions Scoreboard. This Scoreboard edition included a dedicated chapter on consumers in the 'Digital Single Market' where, inter alia, the results of the 2105 DSM consumer survey were presented:
